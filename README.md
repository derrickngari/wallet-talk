## 🛒 Why I Built This

Many small business owners and traders struggle to keep track of their income and expenses, often relying on memory or paper records. This makes it difficult to know if their business is truly profitable, and leads to missed opportunities for growth.

**WalletTalk** was created to solve this problem.  
Our goal is to empower small business owners with a lightweight, easy-to-use tool that lets them track their accounts in real-time—using just their voice or a few taps on their phone. By making financial tracking as simple as talking, WalletTalk helps entrepreneurs make smarter decisions, stay organized, and grow their businesses with confidence.
